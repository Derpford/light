# L I G H T
## Rough Outline
1. MC believes a Long Dark will come soon
2. The light in their room won't be enough to protect them
3. to get more light, they'll have to go down, but the further down they go, the darker it'll get
4. past the cellar, there is an ancient machine that extends into the bowels of the earth
5. deep within that machine is a great and terrible light, so powerful that even the Long Dark cannot snuff it out

## Mechanical stuff
- When the player first takes damage from darkness, a horrible monster is spawned somewhere on the map
- it moves toward the player at a rate based on their health and how dark the player's surroundings are; staying in the dark at 1 HP basically engages Pizza Tower Lap 3 mode
- monster stops at a distance based on player health, assuming that this would be a dark enough spot; at about 10% HP, it goes for the kill
- taking pills recovers some health and makes the monster stop moving for a bit. It also makes the monster vanish.
- makes a sound when moving--think spider legs on glass or metal

## Stage 1: Cellar and Machine Mouth
The MC has to travel into the place below the basement. Introduce basic concepts of how light and dark affect player. Basically, a more polished version of the current map01-map02. Minimal surrealism. Consider making MC's room its own map so I can have interactables or a cutscene (probably just interactables). Easter egg if player spends enough time idling in this room?

## Stage 2: Refraction Unit
A series of factory-like complexes, with strange machines that glow unnaturally. Introduce "moving" light sources. Introduce the Holes, an "enemy" that follows patrol paths and teleports the player to inconvenient places if they get too close. Holes die if you throw a flare into them.

## Stage 3: Lumen Processor
As the MC goes deeper, they find their way into a massive computational complex that runs on light. Surrealism starts to increase here. Puzzles involving light taking specific paths through an area--switchable light sources? sequences? Fewer Holes here, but they're still present in some areas.

## Stage 4: Damaged Facility
This part of the machine is broken. Lights are much more stark. Introduce a Hole variant that follows the player directly. Surrealism at full tilt.

## Stage 5: The Core
Peaceful. Brightly-lit. There are many dormant Holes here. Don't wake them up.
